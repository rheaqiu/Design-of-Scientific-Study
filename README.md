# Factorial-Experiment-Design-and-Analysis

This is a class project for STA305 Design and Analysis of Experiments. Each student will design, analyse, and communicate the results of a homemade replicated 2^k factorial experiment, where k â‰¥ 2. That is, the number of replications is at least two, and the experiment should include 8 measurements at the minimum.

For this project, I investigated the factors that could be draining my laptop battery, in order to make my laptop battery last longer. 
I carried out an experiment to see whether displaying video, turning on Wifi, and adjusting the screen brighter would speed up draining
my laptop battery.
